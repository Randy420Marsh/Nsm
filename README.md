**Nsm** is a simple NDI monitor app that focuses on a single function:
displaying an NDI video stream.

[NDI]Â® (Network Device Interface) is a standard developed by [Vizrt] that
enables applications to deliver video streams over a local area network. For
more information about the technology, please visit [ndi.video][NDI].

There are no pre-built apps for other platforms (Android/iOS). You will need to
install Unity and manually build the project.

## How to Use

- Select an NDI source from the dropdown list.
- You can hide the dropdown list by clicking on an empty space on the screen.
  Click again to make the dropdown reappear.

## Command Line Arguments

The following arguments are available:

| Option                  | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `--source [NDI name]`   | Connect to the specified NDI source. |
| `--hide-ui`             | Hide the dropdown list on startup.   |

You can also use the [Unity Player command line arguments]. For instance, you
can launch the app in windowed mode by adding `-screen-fullscreen 0` to the arguments.
